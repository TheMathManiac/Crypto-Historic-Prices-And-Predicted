## What Is The Crypto-Historic-Prices-And-Predicted Project?

* To utilise an API to gain real-time data on cryptocurrencies, clean and store this data into a dataframe, apply machine learning techniques, and graphically visualize the outcomes.

## The Goal Of The Project?

* To be able to compare actual and predicted cryptocurrency prices using the LSTM model, in order to gain an understanding of the predictive power of these machine learning models for crypto prices.

## Technologies Used For This Project?

* Python
